1-Categorize the problem The next step is to categorize the problem. Categorize by the input: If it is a labeled data, it’s a supervised learning problem. If it’s unlabeled data with the purpose of finding structure, it’s an unsupervised learning problem. If the solution implies to optimize an objective function by interacting with an environment, it’s a reinforcement learning problem. Categorize by output: If the output of the model is a number, it’s a regression problem. If the output of the model is a class, it’s a classification problem. If the output of the model is a set of input groups, it’s a clustering problem.  2-Understand Your Data Data itself is not the end game, but rather the raw material in the whole analysis process. Successful companies not only capture and have access to data, but they’re also able to derive insights that drive better decisions, which result in better customer service, competitive differentiation, and higher revenue growth. The process of understanding the data plays a key role in the process of choosing the right algorithm for the right problem. Some algorithms can work with smaller sample sets while others require tons and tons of samples. Certain algorithms work with categorical data while others like to work with numerical input.
